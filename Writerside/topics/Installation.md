# Installation

macOS and Linux come with an outdated version of Python 3 by default. To get the latest version, you can install it as follows:

- **All operating systems**: Download the latest version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Windows**: Install it via the Microsoft Store
- **macOS** Install it using Homebrew
- **Linux** Install it through your package manager

In some cases, depending on the operating system and installation method chosen, the `python` command may not work, and you need to use `python3` instead

We can verify the Python interpreter in use with the following command:

```bash
python --version
```
